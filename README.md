# Artist Stats
Welcome to Artist Stats (Working Name)! This is a WIP repository for my personal project that intersect two of my passions: music and software developing. 

## Vision
Finding new artists, songs, and genres is a hobby of mine. This hobby often lead me to discover many underground, up-and-coming artists. One artist that comes to mind is Ichiko Aoba with her recent explosion in popularity on social media platforms with her hit song "Asleep Among Endives". 

I wanted a way where I could keep track of a music artist's popularity to see how often I am able to spot artists exploding to popularity. Not so much for the purposes of gatekeeping, but definetely with bragging rights in mind.

So this is a project that can serve as a tool for me to not only keep track of the growth of the artists I follow, but also a place where I can aggregate my personal music data into one place.
